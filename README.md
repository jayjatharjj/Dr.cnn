# DR.CNN "Diabetic Retinopathy using Convolutional Neural Network"

The DR.CNN Web Application is a user-friendly and powerful tool designed to aid in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy. Users can easily upload fundus images of their retina to the application. The application employs a combination of advanced image processing techniques, including augmentation and segmentation, to enhance the quality of the input images and extract relevant features.

Powered by state-of-the-art open-source trained models, the DR.CNN Web Application performs precise predictions on the stage of diabetic retinopathy present in the uploaded image. The predictions are based on deep learning algorithms that have been extensively trained on a diverse dataset, ensuring accurate and reliable results.

Whether you're a healthcare professional, researcher, or an individual concerned about your eye health, the DR.CNN Web Application provides an accessible and efficient means of assessing diabetic retinopathy risk from the comfort of your own device.


## Installation

Step 1: First you need to install Python and React 

To install React:

```bash
  sudo apt install npm
  npm install
  npm install react-scripts
```
To install Python:

```bash
  sudo apt sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

Step 2: Create a virtual environment

```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  sudo apt-get install python3-venv
  . venv/bin/activate
```

Step 3: Install all the packages for Python

```bash
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  pip install flask
```
**Don't forget** pip install each and every package from requirements.txt

## Reqiured adjustments

Download the models from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G5-z9c3LPbntjoExjdpXvb19t4wQ18ok?usp=drive_link

After downloading, put these models in Flask folder


## Running the application

To run the application, run the following commands

```bash
  cd React
  python3 application.py
```
This will start the flask server

```bash
  cd Flask
  npm start
```
This will start the react application and you are good to go!
